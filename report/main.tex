\chapter{Full channel simulation}

\section{Structure}
Now that every block of the transmission channel has been built and tested separately, the full channel can be simulated. It's structure is the following:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pic/Full_channel.png}
    \caption{Full channel structure}
    \label{fig:full_channel}
\end{figure}

As it is not highlighted on the diagram, it should be mentioned that the time error is corrected before the CFO estimate at the frame acquisition module.
\vspace{-0.5cm}

\section{Single pilot}
The following figure shows the error between the input and the output bits of the channel and the position of the pilot:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pic/full_0.eps}
    \caption{Error between input and output bits for a single pilot ($N=50$, $K=12$)}
    \label{fig:full_0}
\end{figure}
As expected, the error is very low close at the beginning of the packet. This proves that the Gardner algorithm has successfully estimated the time offset and the CFO estimation was close to the real value. \\
Errors start to appear after $4000$ bits due to the linearly increasing phase added by the CFO. This simple example showed the importance of having multiple pilots in a packet.

\section{Multiple pilots}

As shown on figure \ref{fig:CFO_std_CFO_N}, the standard deviation of the CFO estimation is lowered for a longer pilot but it still remains different from zero. This means that multiple pilots should be sent in order to have a better estimation of the CFO. \\
This is what has been done in the following simulation. A total of $10$ pilots of $N=50$ bits have been sent in a packet of $10.000$ bits. The CFO is computed based on each pilot separately and the final estimation is the average of the individual estimations. The estimated CFO of the case in figure \ref{fig:full_1} is $3.098$ ppm for an actual value of $3$ ppm, which is quite close.\\
Because the channel is fully simulated, awgn is present and the $E_b/N_0$ is set to $10$ dB. \\
Once again, most of the errors are located closer to the end of the packet because the phase shift due to uncorrected CFO is linearly increasing with the bit index.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{pic/full_1.eps}
    \caption{Error between input and output bits for multiple pilots ($N=50$, $K=30$)}
    \label{fig:full_1}
\end{figure}

For this same case, the constellation diagrams of different signals are shown in figure \ref{fig:full_2}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The one in the top left corner is the input signal. 
    \item Below it, the output signal if no CFO compensation and no time shift corrector are applied. It is chaotic and no information can be retrieved from it.
    \item The top right corner shows the output signal after the Gardner algorithm has been applied. The time shift is corrected but the CFO is still present. The constellation is now made of 2 circles, which already shows that the modulation used is QAM-16. Those circles are the result of the CFO (as shown previously in figure \ref{fig:CFO_const})
    \item The bottom right corner shows the output signal after the Gardner algorithm and the CFO compensation have been applied. The points are now grouped around the initial constellation points. They are not perfectly aligned because the CFO estimation is not perfect and because of the noise added to the signal.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Orange visit}

\subsection{Describe the architecture of the HFC network and its main components. Where is the capacity bottleneck today?}

HFC stands for Hybrid Fiber Coaxial. It means that the network is made of both fiber optic and coaxial cables. The optic fiber is used between the headend and the \textit{nodes} and the coaxial cables are used from those nodes to the individual houses. \\
The coaxial part is the bottleneck but upgrading to fiber is very expensive and would need a cooperation between the different operators.

\subsection{What will be the evolution of the HFC network in the coming years? What are the key technologies to make this happen?}

The \textit{nodes} discussed in the previous question will be shifted towards the houses and, after some time, the objective is to have a direct fiber connection from the headend to each house. This is done by splitting the light for downstream and a \textit{time division multiplexing} for upstream traffic. 

\subsection{Which are the typical incidents happening on Orange's network? Explain the procedure foreseen to cope with them.}

A typical incident is a broken cable. It can happen due to civil works, weather conditions and so on. \\
If no signal can be sent through the line, the broken segment is identified and the exact distance at which it broke is computed using the \textit{Optical Time Domain Reflectometer} (OTDR). It computes the time it takes for a light pulse to go through the fiber and come back (bounce due to unproper termination).\\
A technician is then sent to the location to solder the two broken fiber ends together and all of it happens in typically less than 8 hours.

\subsection{Describe the main Orange's data center in numbers (storage, in/out capacity, consumed power, area, maintenance...). How does it compare to others?}

Not much data was given about the data center. It consumes $1.5$ MW of power (which will increase to $3$ MW when the datacenter will be used at full capacity). The building is $3.000$ m$^2$ large and the data center moves $23$ TB of data every second. It also requires 2 technicians to be maintained. \\
It is complicated to compare it to other data centers because the data is not public.
