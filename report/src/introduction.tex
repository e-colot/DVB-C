\chapter{Introduction}

This report aims to complete the code that simulates a DVB-C transmission chain in matlab. It provides additionnal information from the theoretical part of the project. \\
The first part builds the transmission chain and link the blocks together such that the received signal is the same as the one transmitted (in a noiseless case). \\
